### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
This is my second solo project. I am in the fifth week of Turing School of Software and Design's Front End software development program. It took me about a day to get all of the styling done and the functionality working.

### Contributors:

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
This project demonstrates my ability to to match a given comp with HTML and CSS styling while also adding my own stylistic flare. Is uses JavaScript classes to update the data model and a main JavaScript file to update the DOM. Functions have been refactored to be succint and improve readability. 

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
One challenge that I faced was trying to figure out how to use the .includes() array method to compare my player's choices to the possible winning combinations. I did some research and found another method, .every(), that made more sense to me in this circumstance. I figured out how to use it and got it to work quickly!
